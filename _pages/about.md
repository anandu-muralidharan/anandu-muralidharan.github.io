Hi, I am a final-year master's student in the discipline of Functional Materials and Nanotechnology at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India. I previously completed my undergraduate studies with honours in the discipline of Materials Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, India

My current research interests are in the domain of electrochemistry and computational materials science. My current projects primarily involve using computational techniques, such as DFT and molecular dynamics simulations, to study energy materials used in batteries and fuel cells. One of the projects I am currently working on involves the molecular dynamics study of ZIF-8 (a MOF structure) as the cathode structures for Lithium-Sulfur batteries. 
During my undergraduate studies, I have done many multidisciplinary research projects in the field of nanoplasmonics and optoelectronics.

During my free time, I enjoy drawing and reading novels.
