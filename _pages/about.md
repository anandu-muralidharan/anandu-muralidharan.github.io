Hi, I am a senior undergraduate in the discipline of Materials Engineering at Indian Institute Of Technology Gandhinagar, India. I am going to start my MTech journey in Functional materials and nanotechnology at IIT Madras this fall.
During my undergraduate studies, I have done many multidisciplinary research in the field of nanoplasmonics and optoelectronics. As I am interested in working in the domain " Machine learning in material science", I am currently learning the basics of ML. The projects and notes that I will be making will be updated in the Projects tab of this webpage. 
During my free time, I enjoy drawing and reading novels. I will be creating a new page for displaying my artworks soon.
